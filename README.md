* [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)
  * jsdom is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js. In general, the goal of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real-world web applications.

##### Development utilities:

* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
  * nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
